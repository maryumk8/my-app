**React TypeScript Boilerplate**

This project is a React TypeScript boilerplate that includes several essential features and tools for building scalable React applications. It comes pre-configured with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, routing, testing setups, internationalization, and several other development utilities.

**Features**
TypeScript: Strongly-typed React components and state management.
React Router DOM: Routing setup, including private route components.
Redux Toolkit: Efficient global state management.
Ant Design: Pre-installed UI component library.
Sass: For advanced styling with nested CSS and variables.
i18next: Internationalization support.
React Testing Library & Jest: Setup for component and integration testing.
MSW (Mock Service Worker): API mocking for tests and development.
Prettier & ESLint: Code formatting and linting for consistent coding style.
Suspense & Lazy Loading: For optimizing load times of routes and components.
